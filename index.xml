      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Aidan and I am a software engineer based in Ireland. I studied Computer Applications &amp;amp; Software Engineering at Dublin City University. I am passionate about all things tech, especially about anything that lives on the internet which includes web apps, mobile apps and everything in between!
After graduating from university in 2020, I joined Fidelity Investments as a Software Engineering Associate which is where I still work today. Here, I work on a vast array of interesting and exciting projects on a daily basis.</description>
